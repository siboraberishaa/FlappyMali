This game is a customized version of the classic FlappyBird game, based on a project tutorial from a YouTube video. While following the core mechanics from the video, I have added several unique features to enhance the game play experience.


Inspired by the "Build Flappy Bird with React Native: Skia & Reanimated Tutorial" a tutorial from notJust.dev on the youtube platform, this project extends the basic mechanics with additional features and customizations. You can find the youtube tutorial in [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/9F4aICEisVI?si=Lt17vtKNOrK4reD0)
